# scratchy
A simple scratchpad edit window for win32.

The program just instantiates an edit control as an entire application.  I often use a dummy Notepad window to copy text to and from in order to remove rich text formatting and to jot down throwaway notes.  When I shut down Windows, these unsaved Notepad sessions sometimes halt the process, so I thought I'd make a simple scratchpad note-taking application.

I had tried out this concept years ago. I was amazed that a control that's intended to be a child window can actually function as a main window for an application.
